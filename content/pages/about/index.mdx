### Hello World 👋🏼

Welcome to my personal website. I'm Karthik Singh, but on the internet, I usually go by Katic. Here, I share my experiences, ideas, projects, and other fun things that I do in my life.

After graduating in 2020, I started my career as a Business Strategist at a healthcare startup called Lifespark Technologies. During my time there, I discovered my love for financial markets. I began actively trading and investing in the market while also writing extensively about personal finance. After a few months, I decided to join a young startup called Bullsmart to learn about the financial markets from an insider's perspective.

Although I initially joined Bullsmart as a financial writer, I actively participated in many teams, including product development. In this role, I conducted extensive market research and identified opportunities to drive the success of a new product. 

Through my interactions with various stakeholders in the ecosystem, I realised the potential of technology to transform the face of finance. With advancements being made in blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, the possibilities looked limitless. 

I wanted to be a part of the change I was envisaging. And since then I've been learning software development. I am proficient in several programming languages and tools, including Javascript, React JS, Node JS, Python, FastAPI, MongoDB, and Docker. 

Outside of work, I enjoy writing code as a hobby, examining the stock market, reading philosophical books and discussing new ideas in general. I promise to stay active on this blog and share my knowledge and experiences.
