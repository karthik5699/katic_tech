## Open AI's new ChatGPT API

I tried my hands on the new ChatGPT API to build a chatbot that acts as an investment advisor and gives specific recommendations rather than vague statements.

I have used Gradio in this tutorial to run the machine learning model and build a web interface. It is one of the most popular options out there.

Before we dive into the code, install gradio and openai modules with pip, which is a package manager for python.

```
pip install gradio, openai
```

Now, after installing the modules, create a new file called web.py in the editor of your choice. I personally like to use VSCode.

To be able to use OpenAI's ChatGPT API, you will need to create an API key, which is quite straighforward.

In your `web.py` file, import the modules we just installed:

```
import gradio as gr
import openai
```

Gradio's Interface class can wrap any python function along with a simple, yet elegant user interface.

Take a look at the following example, from their [documentation](https://gradio.app/quickstart/):

```
import gradio as gr

def greet(name):
    return "Hello " + name + "!"

demo = gr.Interface(
    fn=greet,
    inputs=gr.Textbox(lines=2, placeholder="Name Here..."),
    outputs="text",
)
demo.launch()
```

As an input, you can use anything like image, mp3 etc,.

Now let us get back to building our app.

```
import gradio as gr
import openai
import subprocess

#enter the open ai api key
openai.api_key = "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"

messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert investment advisor. Be concise, clever and give specific recommendation. If you do not have enough information to give specific recommendations, don't hesitate to ask the user"},]

#create a function to pass into the gradio interface
def transcribe(audio):
    global messages
    # print(audio)
    audio_file= open(audio, "rb")
    transcript = openai.Audio.transcribe("whisper-1", audio_file)
    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": transcript['text']})
    #chatgpt
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
                model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
                messages=messages)
    
    system_message = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": system_message})

    chat_transcript = ""
    for message in messages:
        if message['role']!='system':
            chat_transcript += message['role'] + ': ' + message['content'] + '\n\n'
                   
    return chat_transcript

demo = gr.Interface(fn=transcribe, inputs=gr.Audio(source = "microphone", type = 'filepath'), outputs="text")

#share = True creates a sharabale link with the world
demo.launch()
```
